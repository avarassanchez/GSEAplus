The software is presented into two distinct modes: web page and command line.

Selection of most relevant GSEA+ functionalities:
* Multiplots of enrichments over several pre-ranked lists and gene sets of RNA-seq experiments.
* Huge range of customization options to modify which outputs are displayed and how they look alike.
* Obtain personalised ready-to-publish figures.
* Gene finder to locate (if possible) in the enrichment progfile the searched genes.
* Zoomed version of the classical GSEA plot to get a more precise view of the desired section.
* Generation of a compact and well-structured report to present the most relevant output and additional interpretations.
